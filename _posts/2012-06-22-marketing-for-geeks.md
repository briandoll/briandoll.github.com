I recently gave this talk at [WebVisions in Portland](http://www.webvisionsevent.com/portland/) and at [Nordic Ruby in Sweden](http://nordicruby.org/). Several people asked what books and blogs I'd recommend to learn more about marketing, so I've put together a list of things that have influenced me.

### Resources

* [VoiceAndTone.com](http://voiceandtone.com/) - MailChimp's guidance on the voice they use in all communication. You'll want to re-write every error message in your product after reading this.
* [Clay Christensen's Milkshake Marketing](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6496.html) - also known as the "Jobs to be Done" framework. I'd suggest reading everything you can about this idea. I can't think of a better framework to use when considering how to market a product.
* Everything [Des Traynor](http://twitter.com/destraynor) writes at the [Intercom.io blog](http://blog.intercom.io/) is pure gold. Read every post a few times through, they're worth it.
* I read [Steven H. Nobel's post on churn](http://www.shopify.com/technology/4018382-defining-churn-rate-no-really-this-actually-requires-an-entire-blog-post) on the Shopify blog every other month or so. I'm looking forward to more in-depth posts like this from them.
* [Fred Wilson's blog](http://www.avc.com/) is always a great read. He runs a series of posts called ["MBA Mondays"](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/mba-mondays/) which is a great way to get up to speed on financing and business concepts.
* [Derek Sivers blog](http://sivers.org/), especially his [notes on books he's recently read.](http://sivers.org/book)
* [Anything You Want by Derek Sivers](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00506NRBS) - short stories by Derek on his CDBaby days. This book has lots of great anecdotes that rarely ever follow the typical and boring path.
* [Seth Godin's blog](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) is full of pithy and interesting ideas.
* [Seth's book Linchpin](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591843162/) is about the new model of work.
* [Seth's book We Are All Weird](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1936719223) sums up much of what was in his previous marketing books. The mass market is dead, long live niche markets.
