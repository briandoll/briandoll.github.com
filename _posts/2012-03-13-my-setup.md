title: My Setup
---

I love reading [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/) and thought I'd do my own interview to document what I'm using these days to get things done.

## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Brian Doll](http://emphaticsolutions.com), a business and technology hacker that runs marketing at [GitHub](https://github.com). I've been [building things on the web professionally since 1997](http://www.linkedin.com/in/briandoll) and have been involved in marketing for the past few years.

## What hardware are you using?

I've got a maxed-out [13" MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/) and I love it. At my desk at work, I connect it to a 27" Apple Cinema Display, but I still use the laptop keyboard and trackpad when I'm docked. I really like the touchpad and keeping it close means never having to reach far for a mouse.

At home I have a second generation Mac Mini that I use primarily as a media center serving my similarly old AppleTV. I store everything on a [2TB Western Digital My Book](http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-My-Book-Studio/dp/B0016P7H3Q/ref=dp_cp_ob_e_title_2) drive.

At one point I had a dozen or so custom-build servers running at my house, but I grew to appreciate the simplicity and quiet of hosting things at a colo and then to a VPS with [SliceHost](http://www.slicehost.com/).

I have a [stand-up desk from IKEA](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S89843460/#/S09843459) at home. I sit and stand at various desks, couches and tables [at work](http://web.stagram.com/location/3774811), and find myself at [coffee shops in Marin](http://www.yelp.com/biz/marin-coffee-roasters-san-anselmo) just as often.

My phone is an [iPhone 4S](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) and I love the [basic kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051QVESA/) for reading books and articles (sent through [Readability](http://www.readability.com/)).

For sketching ideas and making countless lists of things, I love [Pigma Micron pens](http://www.pearlpaint.com/shop-Pigma-Micron-Pen_5919_5931.html) and [Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/) notebooks. I love my Moleskines too, but Field Notes are easier to stuff into a back pocket.

I'm rarely without music, so headphones are important. For long sessions in a cone of silence, I love the [Sennheiser HD-280 Pros](http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-280-Pro-Headphones/dp/B000065BPB), but I'm usually wearing my [Etymotic Research ER7](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YTPP72/) "canalphones", which are also great for phone calls and pairing over Skype or Google Hangout.

## And what software?

I've been slowly slimming down the list of software I use on a regular basis. I use [Sparrow](http://sparrowmailapp.com/) for email on my mac and iPhone and Chrome is my browser of choice. For focused programming (mostly in Ruby), I use [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) full-screen, running a tmux session with Vim and a few bash shells. I use a variety of [unix tools](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/set-operations-in-unix-shell/) as well for data analysis. I use git for version control and keep all [my code on github](https://github.com/briandoll), including my [dotfiles](https://github.com/briandoll/dotfiles).

I use [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) for writing and programming, and use [Marked](http://markedapp.com/) to preview my Markdown documents, which we use a lot at GitHub. [Propane](http://propaneapp.com/) for Campfire [Textual](http://www.codeux.com/textual/) for IRC and iChat make it easy to keep in touch with everyone. Twitter, Instagram and [Pro HDR](http://eyeappsllc.com/Home.html) are the apps I used most on my iPhone.

I use [Atmos'](http://atmos.org) [smeagol](https://github.com/atmos/smeagol) to set up the initial development environment on my mac. I don't know what I would do without [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/), [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) and [rdio](http://rdio.com). [Wunderlist](http://www.wunderlist.com/) keeps my on track and I use [Evernote](http://evernote.com) to keep all the things I'd otherwise forget. For [presentations](http://speakerdeck.com/u/briandoll) I use Keynote, and [Viewfinder](http://connectedflow.com/viewfinder/) for finding creative-commons photos.

## What would be your dream setup?

I'd like my glasses to be able to turn into a high-resolution monitor. Of course they would also need to support AirPlay. Other than that, I'd like the internet to be faster. That'll do.
