title: GitHub, an egalitarian love story
---

I gave this talk in November at [Open Fest](http://openfest.org/) in Sofia, Bulgaria. The word _egalitarian_ struck me as a great way to describe the essence of our culture at GitHub. This talk reviews the tenets of egalitarianism and relates them to git, [GitHub.com](https://github.com/), GitHub the company, and open source software in general. There were a lot of really great questions from the audience after the talk, which are also included in the video.
