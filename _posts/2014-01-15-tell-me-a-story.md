title: Tell Me A Story
---

I gave a presentation at [PHP Conference Argentina](http://www.phpconference.com.ar/) in Buenos Aires recently. I talked about the benefits of story telling as they apply to marketing our products, services and even our open source projects.

Here is the video and slides from the presentation. I'd love to [hear your thoughts](https://twitter.com/briandoll).
