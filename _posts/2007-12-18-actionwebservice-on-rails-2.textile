h1. {{ page.title }}

Well, I can't just say _nothing_ about the recent release of Rails 2 _(.0.2)_, right?

One of the apps I'm working on uses a SOAP web service.  I know, how old skool.  As you have likely read, "ActionWebService (AWS) has been ousted from rails core.":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-it-s-done

While I certainly don't know enough about the intricacies of the ruby load path(s) as they pertain to gems (frozen or unfrozen), the suggestion to just _gem install actionwebservice_ just doesn't seem to work.

"Zack Chandler @ Depixelate shows us how it's done":http://www.depixelate.com/2007/12/13/actionwebservice-with-rails-2-0

Thanks again Zack!
