title: 2012, A look back
---

A brief look back over what I've been up to in 2012. ([2011](http://emphaticsolutions.com/2012/01/26/2011-a-look-back.html))

I [started at GitHub in February](https://github.com/blog/1042-brian-doll-is-a-githubber) which has been life-changing in several ways. [GitHub works differently](https://speakerdeck.com/holman/how-github-works-v2) and I can't imagine working any other way. I'll elaborate on this more in another post.

### Learning

* Marketing: Not just marketing, but GitHub marketing, which is much more about taste, product improvements and customers than anything else.
* Growth: We had a [big year](https://github.com/blog/1359-the-octoverse-in-2012) for growth at GitHub. I'm still learning the ropes of growing a business at this pace, and it's been incredible.
* Public Relations: I ran PR for just long enough to know that we needed someone amazing to focus on it full-time. [Liz](https://github.com/blog/1294-liz-clinkenbeard-is-a-githubber) started in October and is already off to an amazing start.
* Speaking: I only gave [three talks this year](http://emphaticsolutions.com/talks.html), but I felt like these were my best yet. I'm looking forward to more story telling in 2013.
* Passion: Witnessing what is possible when [140 passionate people](https://github.com/about/team) do the best work of their life is inspiring and addicting.

### Personal changelog

I made some changes to my digital and computing life in 2012:

* [No monitor w/ 13" MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/) - Fullscreen apps when possible, focus focus focus
* [iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/) - I've been digging the iPad 2 for reading and catching up on things in the evenings
* [Things.app](http://culturedcode.com/things/) - I'm back to Things.app after years away, getting my GTD on
* [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) - After trying tons of "read it later" apps, Pocket for Mac, iPad and iPhone are perfect
* [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) - Using GitHub fulltime has been amazing and keeps getting better
* [Concentrate](http://www.getconcentrating.com/) - Great app to curtail distractions and get down to business
* [Instagram](http://instagram.com/briandoll) - Love my instagram feed and love sharing good snaps

2012 was pretty great.  2013 is going to be even better.
