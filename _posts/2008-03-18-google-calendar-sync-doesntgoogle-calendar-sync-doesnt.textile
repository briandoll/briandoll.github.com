title: Google Calendar Sync Doesn't
---

Many folks were near jubilation when Google "announced Google Calendar Sync":http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/google-calendar-sync.html.  It's a windows application that lives in the dock that handles the chaos involved in syncing two calendars, not to mention dealing with Exchange.  Unfortunately, for business users the _hoorah!_ did not last very long.

Users will need to pay special attention when reading the "known issues":http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/static.py?page=known_issues.cs to find:
<blockquote>
	Currently, Google Calendar Sync requires that you're either the organizer or a guest on an event to sync it properly.<br/><br/></blockquote>
Translation:
<blockquote>
	If you are attempting to sync an Outlook calendar that keeps appointments for you at _user@somecompany.com_ with a Google Calendar registered to _foo@gmail.com_ you're out of luck.  Unless _foo@gmail.com_ is invited to that meeting, it won't sync.<br/><br/></blockquote>
You'll note that the FAQ did say _"currently"_, so hopefully this will change soon.  In the mean time, if you're not looking forward to the chaos of tools, options and hacks available to perform this syncing magic, you'll just have to check two calendars for a while longer.
